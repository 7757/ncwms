  "body": "## What is ncWMS?\r\n[ncWMS](https://reading-escience-centre.gitbooks.io/ncwms-user-guide/content/) is a [Web Map Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service) for displaying environmental data.\r\n\r\n## Getting ncWMS\r\n[ncWMS](https://reading-escience-centre.gitbooks.io/ncwms-user-guide/content/) is designed to run in a servlet container such as [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) or [Glassfish](https://glassfish.java.net/). However, we do provide a standalone version which uses an embedded [Winstone](http://winstone.sourceforge.net/) servlet container to allow users to quickly try it out.\r\n\r\n### Servlet container version\r\nThis is the standard version of ncWMS which most people will want to use. It can be obtained by downloading `ncWMS2.war` from [here](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/ncwms/releases/latest)\r\n\r\nNote that you will need to configure a security role within your servlet container to be able to use this.\r\n\r\n### Standalone version\r\nThe standalone version of ncWMS can be obtained by downloading `ncWMS2-standalone.jar` from [here](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/ncwms/releases/latest)\r\n\r\nNote that this version is designed to be run locally and has no security for any of the administrative functions. To run a publicly-available version of ncWMS, please use the servlet container version.\r\n\r\n## Seeing ncWMS in Action\r\nWe have a demo site for ncWMS available [here](http://godiva.rdg.ac.uk/ncWMS2/Godiva3.html).\r\n\r\nThe [Global HYCOM viewer](http://viewer.coaps.fsu.edu/GlobalHycom/mapviewer) uses ncWMS in its backend.\r\n\r\nThe [THREDDS Data Server](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/TDS.html) is packaged with a version of ncWMS for viewing THREDDS-catalogued products in a browser.\r\n\r\n[Hyrax](http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/Hyrax) also uses ncWMS2 for visualisation.\r\n\r\nIf you are using ncWMS on a publicly-available website and would like to have it listed here, please [contact us](mailto:resc@reading.ac.uk)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n@guygriffiths, @jonblower, @ndp-opendap, @N-Lin, @purplecat\r\n",
